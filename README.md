# Unexpected Behavior with Implicit Type Conversion Operators in C#

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using implicit type conversion operators in C#.  Implicit conversions, while convenient, can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered.  The example involves a custom class with implicit conversion operators to and from an integer type.

## The Bug
The primary issue lies in the implicit conversion operators.  The lack of explicit error handling or input validation within the operators themselves may mask or cause potentially unforeseen side effects. Improper use of implicit conversions can sometimes lead to hard-to-find bugs due to their automatic nature.

## Solution
The solution is a more robust handling of potential issues.  You may need to introduce explicit checks, error handling, or validation to make the conversions more resilient to unexpected inputs or situations.
